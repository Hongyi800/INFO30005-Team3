##### On the homepage, we have shown the name of the website which is same as our group name. Furthermore, all four core functionalities have been listed on the page.
#### 1)	Functionality 1: Login
##### The first functionality is set for users to sign in the website. When they click ‘Login’ on the homepage, it will turn to a connected new page with a suffix on the original URL. On the new page, we have given two boxes for users to login in with their username and password. After they typing their username and password, they can succeed to enter the website by pressing the button ‘Sign in’. If users enter the correct username and password, it will show “Login successfully” and jump to the homepage. Otherwise, "Error username or password" will appear. As we do not have any database now, our website only has one user who has username “user” and password “12345”.
#### 2)	Functionality 2: User Comment
##### The second functionality is provided a convenient channel with users to exchange their different ideas about the COVID-19 epidemic and provide suggestions for the website we created. If the users would like to post their advice or options, they could click ‘User Comment’ on the homepage. Then, the website will jump to the comment page. On this new page, users may fill in their name or nickname in the ‘name’ column and leave their comments in the box below. After clicking the button ‘send’, their suggestions and points of views could be shown in the ‘Comment List’.
#### 3)	Functionality 3: World Status
##### While clicking ‘World Status’ on the homepage, it will jump to the third functionality. The purpose of this functionality is to afford the world status of the COVID-19 epidemic through trend graphs and data. The users could type in either city or country and press ‘search’ to see the updated number of confirmed cases, deaths and cures in the city or country they concerned about. Since we do not post the database, the data showing in our website might be incorrect. Additionally, we will post several trend graphs based on the current epidemic data later.
##### (Additional functionality: News & Information)
##### For the last functionality, users could find the news and information about basic knowledge and protective measures for coronavirus when clicking ‘News & Information’ on the homepage of our website. Setting this function may help users understand the epidemic situation and protect themselves in a timely and effective manner.
